# Incident Handler's Journal

## Description

A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in primary-care services experienced a significant security incident on a Tuesday morning at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported being unable to access critical files, such as medical records, which led to a complete shutdown of business operations. A ransom note appeared on their screens, indicating that an organized group of hackers had encrypted all company files and demanded a large sum of money for the decryption key. The attackers gained access via phishing emails containing malicious attachments that installed ransomware.

## Scenario

I'm documenting a ransomware attack at a health care clinic where employees lost access to critical files due to a ransomware infection. The attack was initiated through phishing emails, and the clinic's operations were halted as a result. The attackers’ demand for a ransom adds complexity to the incident, requiring a decision on how to proceed.

| The 5 W's           | ● **Who**: An organized group of unethical hackers <br> ● **What**: A ransomware security incident <br> ● **Where**: At a health care company <br> ● **When**: Tuesday 9:00 a.m. <br> ● **Why**: The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. |
| Additional notes    | 1. How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again? <br> 2. Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key? |
